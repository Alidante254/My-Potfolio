                    <strong>||Back-end developer</strong> <br>
                    <p>
                        A backend developer is a software engineer who specializes in building and maintaining the server-side component of web applications. Their primary responsibilities include designing, building, and integrating the server-side components and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that are used by the frontend of a web application to interact with the underlying data.
                          Backend developers typically use programming languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, C#, PHP, and Node.js to build server-side components and implement features such as authentication, authorization, payment processing, and database management. They also work with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Cassandra to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.

                    <p>
                        A full-stack developer is a software engineer who has the skills and knowledge to work on both the frontend and backend of a web application. They have a comprehensive understanding of the entire web development process, from the client-side user interface to the server-side infrastructure.
                          Full-stack developers have expertise in a variety of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend development and one or more server-side programming languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, PHP, or Node.js. They also need to be familiar with databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL and understand how to interact with them using Structured Query Language (SQL).                    </p>

                    In this example, we create a button with a class of floating-action-button and inside the button, we have an icon (created using font-awesome). The CSS sets the background color, size, border radius, box shadow, position, etc. of the button to give it the appearance of a floating action button. You can adjust the CSS to suit your needs and use different icons or add additional elements to the button as desired. <br>
                 <br>   In this example, we have a div element with some text and a button. When the button is clicked, the changeDisplay function is called. The function gets the div element using document.getElementById and checks its current display value. If the value is "none", it sets it to "block", making the element visible. If the value is not "none", it sets it to "none", making the element hidden.

                    Note that there are other possible values for the display property, such as "inline", "inline-block", "flex", etc. You can use any of these values depending on your desired display type

                    A mobile app is a software application designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers and other mobile devices. Mobile apps are created to provide users with quick and convenient access to information, services, or functionality.

                    There are two main ways to create a mobile app: native app development and cross-platform app development.
